# Sets SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN on this repo, and proves the token works first.
#
# `setup_sentry.main.kts` does the one-time project setup: it creates the Sentry
# project, writes the DSN, sets SENTRY_ORG and SENTRY_PROJECT. This script does
# the one thing you come back for, which is fixing or rotating the CI token, and
# it is the half that has actually gone wrong.
#
# **It validates before it sets.** That is the entire point. A token that
# authenticates but cannot upload looks identical to a working one until a
# release build fails, and the failure is easy to miss: on iOS `fastlane` logs
# sentry-cli's error and carries on, so the run stays green. Drop2048 carried a
# rejected token for nine days that way, set 2026-09-16 and first noticed when
# the Android release job died on 2026-09-25.
#
# The check is `GET /organizations/<org>/chunk-upload/`, which is the endpoint
# sentry-cli actually uploads mappings and dSYMs through, so a 200 here means
# the thing CI does will work. Do not be tempted by a friendlier-looking
# endpoint: an `org:ci` token answers 403 to `/organizations/<org>/` and
# `/projects/<org>/<project>/` while being perfectly good for uploads, so those
# would reject tokens that work.
#
# The token is not per app. One organization token covers every project in the
# org, so the first run saves it to the machine-local credential store the
# Kotlin setup scripts share and later runs in other repos find it there.
#
# Safe to re-run. Needs: gh (logged in), curl.

Other repos in the $ORG organization reuse this token. Run this script in each
