// No @file:DependsOn here on purpose: the setup scripts that import this file
// use only the stdlib, and a dependency declaration makes every cold run
// resolve Maven coordinates over the network (observed hanging the script
// runner entirely on flaky daemons).

/**
 * The shared half of the setup scripts: terminal prompting, and a machine-local
 * store for the credentials that are the same for every project you generate.
 *
 * Import it from a sibling script:
 *
 *     @file:Import("lib/setup_store.main.kts")
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Spinning up a project from the template asks for the same values every time
 * and answers them from scratch every time, so project five is exactly as
 * tedious as project one. This is the one place those answers live.
 *
 * ## Precedence, highest first
 *
 *   1. Environment variable. CI already sets these, so env-first means CI keeps
 *      working untouched and a one-off override stays possible.
 *   2. This store.
 *   3. Prompt.
 *
 * ## The constraint that shapes the whole design: the store is often absent
 *
 * A different laptop, a fresh machine, a CI runner, a contributor who is not
 * you. So the store is an accelerator, never a requirement. Every script that
 * uses it must run correctly with none of it present, which is why
 * [SetupValues] falls back to prompting rather than failing, and why a
 * non-interactive run with a missing required value dies naming the value.
 *
 * ## The half that actually matters: saying what is missing
 *
 * The failure the template has already shipped once is a blank value that is
 * also a supported value — a blank Sentry DSN means "reporting off", so a
 * project with no DSN looks configured and reports nothing, silently, for
 * months. Any store that quietly fills some values and leaves others blank
 * reproduces that bug across every credential it touches. [printPlan] and
 * [printUnconfigured] are what stop it: every run says where each value came
 * from before it starts, and what is still not set (and what that costs) when
 * it finishes.
