# Testing approach

How this codebase tests, layer by layer, and the conventions every new test
follows. The goal is a pyramid where each bug class is caught at exactly one
layer — the cheapest layer that can fail when it breaks.

## The layers

- **Library / feature unit tests** (`commonTest` in each module) — pure logic,
  repositories over fakes, and SEAViewModel behaviour. `SettingsViewModelTest` is
  the reference recipe for VM tests: extend `CoroutineTest` (from
  `:libraries:flowroutines:testing`), hand-roll a fake per repository
  dependency, drive actions, assert on `vm.state`.
- **Scenario harness** (a feature's own `commonTest/`) — when a feature's tests
  keep re-wiring the same fakes, grow a tiny builder + verbs + `assertState {}`
  DSL next to them so tests read as user scenarios. It's a pattern, not a
  framework — copy and adapt, don't generalize.
- **Server unit + route tests** (`:apps:server` `src/test`) — plugins and
  routes through Ktor's `testApplication`, repositories over Testcontainers
  Postgres (`DatabaseTest` base class).
- **Full-stack server test** (`:apps:server` `FullStackMeTest`) — the real DI
  graph over real Postgres through the same `installApp` seam production
  boots, with a `JwtVerification.Static` verifier swapped in. Proves component
  + auth + repository + route integrate; the client side is Ktor's test client.
- **Composition tests** (`androidUnitTest` in a Compose module): a real
  composition, driven and asserted on the host JVM. Only for claims that are
  about composition itself: effects running and disposing, recomposition, what
  is on screen. See below.
- **End-to-end integration** (`:apps:integration`) — the real *client* stack
  against the real server. See below.

## Composition tests

`FloatingWindowHostTest` (`:libraries:navigation`) is the worked example and the
first thing in this repo that ever asserted against a composition. It drives a
real `NavController` and the real `FloatingWindowHost` through push-then-pop and
asserts the popped entry was released. That is a claim about `DisposableEffect`
and recomposition, which no view-model test can reach.

The recipe, to copy:

```kotlin
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class)
@Config(sdk = [35])
class MyThingTest {
    @get:Rule val compose = createComposeRule()
    …
}
```

Where it lives and why: **`androidUnitTest`, not `commonTest`, and not a `jvm()`
target.** `commonTest` also compiles for iOS, where none of the harness
resolves. A `jvm()` target would be the Compose Multiplatform-idiomatic answer
(`runComposeUiTest` on desktop) but it cascades through
`:libraries:{core,ui,resources,sodogku,flowroutines,storage}`, each needing
`actual` stubs for permission launchers and image decoding, plus a third value
on the two-case `Platform` enum that several exhaustive `when`s read. That is a
lot of shipped surface invented to serve tests, and it contradicts the stance
`:apps:integration` already took: reuse the Android variants on the host JVM.

Setup lives in `libraries/navigation/build.gradle.kts`. Two parts are
load-bearing and worth copying wholesale into the next module that wants this:
`testOptions.unitTests.isIncludeAndroidResources = true`, and the
`stageRobolectricJars` task. The second one resolves Robolectric's Android
framework jar through Gradle and runs Robolectric offline against the staged
copy, instead of letting it fetch ~100MB from Maven into `~/.m2` at test time.
Nothing caches `~/.m2` on CI, and a network call inside a test is how a tier
earns a reputation for flaking.

It runs under `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`, so CI's existing unit-test job
already covers it.

**What this layer is not for.** It is slow (a Robolectric sandbox per class) and
it is the easiest place in the codebase to write something that passes for the
wrong reason. Anything a view-model test or a pure-function test can answer
belongs there instead. Do not reach for it to cover the board's gestures.

## The integration harness (`:apps:integration`)

An Android-library module whose tests run as **host-JVM Android unit tests**
(`./gradlew :apps:integration:testDebugUnitTest`) — the same compilation path
the feature view models already use, so the harness can construct them
directly. `commonMain` is deliberately empty: nothing ships from this module,
and the iOS target must never try to link the JVM-only server.

What runs where in a harness test:

- **In-process, real:** a Netty engine on an ephemeral port booted through the
  production `installApp(component, verification, …)` seam
  (`InProcessServer`), and a real `ServerComponent` over a Testcontainers
  Postgres with the real Flyway migrations.
- **In the client, real:** `NetworkClientImpl` with the real headers provider,
  reachability tracker and access-denied bus, and the real
  `RemoteConfigRemoteDataSource` over it (`TestClient`). Requests travel real
  TCP — real serialization, real headers, real status codes.
- **Fake, on purpose:** exactly the seams a device would own — the install and
  session ids, and on-disk persistence (an in-memory `CacheFactory` running the
  real store logic).

`HarnessSmokeTest` pins the worked example: boot the server, seed a config value
in Postgres, and assert a real client reads it back over HTTP — real client →
real TCP → real server → real DB.
New end-to-end flows should follow its shape: add a client surface to
`TestClient`, a probe or seed helper to `InProcessServer` if the server side
needs one, and await state with `awaitState` / `awaitUntil` — never fixed
sleeps. Docker down → the suite skips (JUnit `Assume`), not fails, so a
contributor without Docker still gets a green build. That courtesy is only safe
because it is off on CI: both this harness and the server's `DatabaseTest` turn
the skip into a hard failure when `CI` is set, since a green job that ran none
of its tests is worse than a red one.

**Fault injection** is worth knowing about even though this template doesn't
ship it: when a project grows a long-lived transport (a WebSocket, a sync
loop), wrap the real transport in a *decorator* that can drop, block, or delay
frames on command, and give the harness a switch to install it. The decorator
implements the transport interface and forwards to the real one, so reconnect
and presence machinery is exercised over real plumbing with surgically induced
failures — no mock transport that quietly diverges from the real one.

## Which layer catches which bug (don't duplicate)

When you're tempted to assert the same thing at two layers, the lower one wins
and the higher one doesn't get written.

| Bug class | Owning layer | NOT here |
|---|---|---|
| Pure logic, data mapping, validation rules | library unit tests | never re-tested above |
| Action → state derivation in a VM | feature `commonTest` (VM unit / scenario) | not integration |
| Route status codes, error envelopes, auth challenge shapes | `:apps:server` route tests | not integration |
| SQL, migrations, repository contracts | `:apps:server` Testcontainers tests | not route tests |
| DI graph constructs against a live DB | `FullStackMeTest` | not per-repository tests |
| Effects running/disposing, recomposition, what is on screen | composition tests | not VM tests, which cannot see a composition |
| Client↔server contract drift (serialization, headers, auth handshake, real HTTP semantics) | `:apps:integration` | not unit tests with canned JSON |

Integration tests aren't a substitute for unit tests — they're slower and
harder to debug. Use them for the seam contract (real wire, real plumbing),
not for every rule the lower layers already own.

## Conventions

- **Hand-rolled fakes only.** No Mockito / MockK anywhere. Fakes go in
  `commonTest` next to their consumer, or in a shared `:libraries:x:testing`
  module if reused.
- **Dispatcher choice:** `UnconfinedTestDispatcher` (the `CoroutineTest`
  default) for most tests — continuations run eagerly, mirroring
  `viewModelScope` under `Main.immediate`. `StandardTestDispatcher` only for
  time-sensitive tests (timeouts, debounce, backoff) that need an explicit
  dispatch-then-advance cadence. Integration tests use a **real** Main
  dispatcher (`Dispatchers.setMain(Dispatchers.Default)`) because real sockets
  run on real threads.
- **`runCurrent()` not `advanceUntilIdle()`** when there's an unwanted
  future-scheduled task (e.g. a `withTimeout`) — `advanceUntilIdle()` fires it.
- **`runCatching { … }` not `assertFailsWith { … }` around suspend bodies.**
  `assertFailsWith` has subtle suspend-context issues where an async-thrown
  exception reaches the test scope before the assertion runs. Call the suspend
  function inside `runCatching`, then assert on the captured result.
- **Every test file gets a top-level KDoc** explaining what's covered and
  what's intentionally NOT covered (and where that lives instead).
- **Integration tests belong in `:apps:integration`.** Don't inline a real
  server into a feature-module test.
- **No fixed sleeps.** Await a flow (`awaitState`), or poll with a timeout
  (`awaitUntil`) when the state has no push signal.
