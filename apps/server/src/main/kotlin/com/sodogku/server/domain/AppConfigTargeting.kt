/**
 * The predicate attached to a targeting rule, stored as `conditions_jsonb`.
 *
 * Every field is optional; an unset field is "don't care". A rule matches when
 * **all** set conditions pass. An all-null predicate (`{}`) is an unconditional
 * override at its priority — handy for a temporary global value above the base.
 *
 * Axes:
 *  - [platforms] — `"android"` / `"ios"` / `"other"` (lowercased [ClientContext.Platform]).
 *  - [minVersionCode] / [maxVersionCode] — inclusive build-number range; a
 *    client that doesn't send a build number fails a set bound.
 *  - [minAppVersion] / [maxAppVersion] — **semantic-version** bounds (e.g.
 *    `"1.0.1"`) compared by SemVer precedence against the client's `appVersion`.
 *    The `*Inclusive` flags pick `≥`/`>` and `≤`/`<`, so "version `> 1.0.1`" is
 *    `minAppVersion = "1.0.1", minAppVersionInclusive = false`, and an exact
 *    match is `min == max` both inclusive. A client that doesn't send an app
 *    version fails a set bound (same fail-closed rule as the version code).
 *  - [countries] — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, uppercase (matches `X-Country-Code`).
 *  - [locales] — primary language subtags, lowercase (`"en"`, `"es"`); matches
 *    if any of the client's preferred locales shares a primary subtag.
 *  - [userAllow] / [userDeny] — user-id (UUID string) allow / deny lists.
 *    Deny is a hard veto; allow requires the caller to be a known user in the set.
 *  - [rolloutPercent] — 0–100 staged rollout. Deterministic per
 *    (bucket-key, flag): the same user/install always lands in the same bucket,
 *    so ramping the percentage only ever *adds* users, never reshuffles them.
