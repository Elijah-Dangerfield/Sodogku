/**
 * Installs the Ktor WebSocket plugin with production-proven defaults.
 * Lives in its own file so changing the heartbeat strategy is a
 * single-file edit + the routes don't need to know.
 *
 * Ping cadence (15s) + timeout (30s) means a peer that's gone silent
 * for half a minute gets its session torn down, which fires your route's
 * onClose handler. Any "they might reconnect" grace period belongs in
 * the route's own state, not here.
 *
 * Permessage-deflate compresses anything > 4KB — most event payloads fit
 * under that; the option's here for larger state snapshots.
 *
 * Wire-envelope lesson (learned in production): model socket events as a
 * sealed @Serializable hierarchy with explicit @SerialName discriminators,
 * and decode with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` on the client. That pairing is
 * what lets old clients survive new event types (unknown discriminators are
 * skippable) and new clients survive old servers (missing fields default).
 * Ad-hoc per-message JSON shapes cannot evolve safely.
