 * over the raw `app_config_values` + `app_config_rules` rows, and every
 * mutation appends to the audit log.

 * Edits here become visible to clients on the next [AppConfigSource] cache
 * refresh (its short TTL), not instantly — there's no cross-process bust, by
 * design: config changes are rare and a few seconds of staleness is fine.
