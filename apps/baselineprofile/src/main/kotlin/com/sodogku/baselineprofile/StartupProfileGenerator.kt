/**
 * The **startup** profile: launch to Home, and stop.
 *
 * ## Why this is separate from the journey profile
 *
 * A startup profile is not just "the profile, but smaller". It is placed
 * differently in the DEX layout, and Android's guidance is explicit that an
 * oversized one "overflows into subsequent DEX files… and slows down startup"
 * — the exact opposite of the point.
 *
 * Downstream, both files were once generated from one deep journey with
 * `includeInStartupProfile = true`, which made `startup-prof.txt` and
 * `baseline-prof.txt` byte-for-byte identical at 46,451 rules (verified by
 * matching MD5). The startup profile was carrying the whole app, and was
 * actively working against cold start. Splitting them is the fix, and mirrors
 * what Now in Android does.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT stub the network. Every real cold start runs the HTTP
 * client, session restore, deserialization and crash-reporter init, and that
 * code is on the one path 100% of users take. A benchmark mode that faked it
 * away would delete AOT coverage from precisely the launch this profile exists
 * to speed up.
