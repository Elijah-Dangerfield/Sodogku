/**
 * The journey the profile generators and the R8 smoke test all drive.
 *
 * Shared because the alternative is three copies of the same UiAutomator taps
 * drifting apart, and the first symptom of that drift is a profile that quietly
 * covers less while every assertion still passes.
 *
 * ## Replace this with your app's journey
 *
 * What is here walks the template's own shortest meaningful path: onboarding to
 * Home, then Home into a detail screen and back. Swap the constants and the two
 * journey functions for whatever your app's equivalent is. Keep two things:
 *
 * 1. **The adaptive structure.** [reachHome] walks whatever is on screen rather
 *    than replaying a fixed tap sequence. Onboarding gains and loses steps, and
 *    a hardcoded sequence breaks silently on every one of those changes.
 * 2. **[describeScreen].** A failure that says only "the thing I wanted was not
 *    there" cannot separate an R8 breakage from an error dialog, a spinner, or a
 *    step nobody knew existed. Those need different fixes and guessing between
 *    them costs a full emulator run each time.
 *
 * ## If you add a hook to skip onboarding
 *
 * Generation runs a **release** variant, so a benchmark hook gated on
 * `BuildConfig.DEBUG` is dead exactly where it is needed. Gate on the backend
 * environment instead — which is also what stops a generation run creating real
 * accounts in production. There is no such hook here yet, because this journey
 * walks onboarding for real and the template ships no backend to protect.
 *
 * Nothing on the launch path may be network-bound. An earlier downstream version
 * awaited sign-in inside `onCreate`, which put a network round trip on the main
 * thread: the activity never finished launching and the benchmark failed with a
 * blank screen. Split the local cache write (blocking, short timeout) from
 * anything remote (fire-and-forget).
