/**
 * Thin wrapper around the platform's in-app review API: Android's
 * `ReviewManager.launchReviewFlow()` and iOS's
 * `SKStoreReviewController.requestReview()`. Lives behind an interface
 * so the eligibility gate in [ReviewPromptCoordinator] is fully
 * testable without touching the platform.
 *
 * **Android binding** is `AndroidReviewLauncher` in
 * `:libraries:review:impl/androidMain`. **iOS binding** is `IOSReviewLauncher`
 * (Swift) passed into the DI graph via `IosAppComponent.provideReviewLauncher`.
 *
 * Implementations must not throw: the platform APIs report failure via
 * callbacks / no-ops, and a thrown launcher would punch through a
 * UI-thread coroutine. Swallow + log instead.
