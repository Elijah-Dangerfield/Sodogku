/**
 * Decides whether and when to ask the OS to show a native app-store
 * review prompt. Feature code calls [requestPrompt] at a known
 * positive moment (milestone reached, task completed, clean session
 * end); the coordinator owns the eligibility gate so callers don't
 * re-derive it.
 *
 * Eligibility lives on the client only — install age, last-prompt
 * date, trigger throttling — there is no server round-trip. The OS
 * itself imposes a hard ceiling (≈3 prompts/year on iOS, similar
 * pacing on Android) and silently no-ops past it; the coordinator
 * adds the in-app guard rails on top so we don't burn our annual
 * quota on a user who just installed.
 *
 * Never write a self-built rating dialog as a fallback. If the OS
 * declines to surface the prompt, that's the system working as
 * designed.
