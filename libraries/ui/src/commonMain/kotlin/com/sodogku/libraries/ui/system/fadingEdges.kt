/**
 * Softens the bottom edge of scrollable content, so a list that continues past
 * the fold looks cut off on purpose rather than by the window.
 *
 * The band is anchored to the bottom of the *viewport* and shrinks as the end
 * comes into reach, reaching zero exactly when there is nothing left to scroll.
 * It previously anchored at `height - maxValue + scroll`, which for any content
 * taller than the viewport is a coordinate above the top of the screen — so
 * every visible pixel fell past the gradient's transparent end and `DstIn`
 * erased the lot. It read as the fade covering most of the content and then
 * retreating as you scrolled, which is precisely backwards.
 *
 * The colour is irrelevant and deliberately absent: `DstIn` multiplies the
 * destination by the *source's alpha*, so only the gradient's opacity does any
 * work. Reading a theme colour here is what forced this through `composed`,
 * which allocates on every composition and cannot be skipped.
