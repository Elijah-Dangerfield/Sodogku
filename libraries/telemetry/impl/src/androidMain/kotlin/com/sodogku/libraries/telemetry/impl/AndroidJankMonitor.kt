/**
 * [JankMonitor] backed by AndroidX `JankStats`.
 *
 * `JankStats` reports every frame with a flag for whether it missed its
 * deadline, using the platform's own frame timing rather than a guess. This
 * class supplies the two things it deliberately leaves to the app: which screen
 * a frame belongs to, and how little of it to send.
 *
 * One `app.jank` event per screen visit, never one per frame — a frame callback
 * fires 60 times a second per user, and shipping that would cost more than it
 * could ever tell you. The arithmetic and the reporting threshold live in
 * [JankTally], which is testable without a `Window`.
 *
 * `JankStats` delivers on the main thread, so nothing here needs synchronising.
