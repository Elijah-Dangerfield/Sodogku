/**
 * Process start from the platform itself, via [Process.getStartUptimeMillis].
 *
 * This is the earliest instant any code can observe — earlier than
 * `Application.onCreate`, earlier than the first line of ours to run — which is
 * the whole point. Anything we could time ourselves would already have missed
 * process fork, DEX loading and Application init.
 *
 * Both ends are read in the `SystemClock.uptimeMillis` timebase, so the
 * subtraction is well-defined. That clock pauses in deep sleep, which is the
 * right behaviour here: a device that slept between process start and first
 * frame did not spend that time launching the app.
