/**
 * iOS has no equivalent of `JankStats`: UIKit exposes no per-frame timing with a
 * "did this frame miss its deadline" signal, and reconstructing one from
 * `CADisplayLink` would measure something different enough that comparing the
 * two platforms on one dashboard would mislead rather than inform.
 *
 * So iOS reports no jank at all, deliberately. This is not a stub waiting to be
 * filled in. iOS smoothness regressions are caught through MetricKit's hang
 * reports, which already land as [PreviousExit.Anr]. If `app.jank` ever needs an
 * iOS number, it should arrive as its own metric with its own name, not as this
 * one quietly meaning something else.
