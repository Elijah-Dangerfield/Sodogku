/**
 * How long the app took to become usable, measured from the moment the OS
 * created the process.
 *
 * The gap this fills: `app.launched` says a cold start happened and
 * `previous_exit` says how the last one ended, but neither says how long the
 * user stared at a splash screen. Startup is the one performance number every
 * single user pays on every single cold boot, and it is the number Play
 * Console grades the app on — so it is the one worth watching continuously
 * rather than discovering from a review.
 *
 * Measured from process creation rather than from the first line of Kotlin on
 * purpose. A large share of a cold start is spent before any of our code runs
 * (process fork, DEX/dyld loading, Application init), and a timer started in our
 * own code cannot see any of it. That is exactly the part a Baseline Profile is
 * supposed to improve, so a metric that excluded it would report "no change"
 * after the change that mattered most.
