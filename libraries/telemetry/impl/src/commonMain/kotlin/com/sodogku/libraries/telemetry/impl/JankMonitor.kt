/**
 * Collects how smoothly each screen actually rendered for real users, and
 * reports it as `app.jank`.
 *
 * The gap this fills: `PreviousExit.Anr` tells you a session died, and tells you
 * nothing about what was slow in the minutes before it did. Downstream, four
 * production ANRs were diagnosed by asking a user to capture a Perfetto trace on
 * their own device, which does not scale and only works for a bug someone
 * already reported. Frame data answers the same question continuously, for
 * everyone, and it is the only way "did the RenderThread fix hold" gets an
 * answer better than "the ANR count hasn't moved."
 *
 * **Aggregated, never per-frame.** A frame callback fires 60 times a second per
 * user; logging that would cost more than it tells you and would swamp the pipe.
 * Implementations tally frames against the current route and emit one summary
 * per screen visit.
 *
 * Android-only in practice. There is no equivalent frame-timing API on iOS, so
 * the iOS binding is a no-op rather than a half-measure — better an obvious
 * absence than a metric that silently means something different per platform.
