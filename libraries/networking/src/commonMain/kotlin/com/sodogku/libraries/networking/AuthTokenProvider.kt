/**
 * Narrow contract the network layer needs from auth. Defined here (not in
 * `:libraries:identity`) so the networking layer doesn't transitively depend
 * on the auth state machine.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, deliberately split:
 *
 *  - [awaitReady] is the suspend boundary that drives auth bootstrap to
 *    completion. Called by [NetworkClient.awaitAuthReady] *before* a request
 *    fires, so the request's timeout clock doesn't run during a slow
 *    cold-boot resolve.
 *
 *  - [accessToken] is a peek — synchronous in spirit (still typed as
 *    suspend so impls aren't boxed into a fully-sync model). Called by
 *    Ktor's bearer plugin inside `loadTokens`, by which point [awaitReady]
 *    has already run and a token (or definitive null) is on hand.
 *
 * The split exists so the bearer plugin can't accidentally start a long
 * wait inside Ktor's request lifecycle — that was the cold-boot
 * timeout-eating bug we hit in production.
