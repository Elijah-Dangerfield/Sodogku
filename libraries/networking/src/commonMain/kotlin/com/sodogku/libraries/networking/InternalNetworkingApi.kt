 * Marks low-level network surfaces (raw [HttpClient][io.ktor.client.HttpClient]
 * accessors on [NetworkClient]) that callers should NOT reach for under normal
 * use. The blessed paths are [NetworkClient.authedCall],
 * [NetworkClient.unauthedCall], and [NetworkClient.authedWebSocketSession] —
 * they handle auth-readiness waiting, retry, and structured logging so every
 * request flows through one code path.
 *
 * Direct HttpClient access bypasses those guarantees. The annotation exists
 * so the compiler tells you about that bypass at the call site. Test
 * fakes opt in via `@OptIn(InternalNetworkingApi::class)`.
