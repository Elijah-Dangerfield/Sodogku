/**
 * Authenticated HTTP call wrapper.
 *
 * Consults [NetworkClient.authVerdict] first: a Blocked verdict (no session,
 * offline, guest where a claimed account is needed, …) short-circuits to a
 * typed [AuthUnready] failure without touching the wire — no phantom 401s.
 * Callers surface it with `mapAuthFailure { reason -> ... }`, ignore it with
 * `getOrNull()`, or route on it with `onAuthFailure { ... }`; a call that does
 * nothing special is already correct by default. [requirement] defaults to
 * [AuthRequirement.Account]; only the rare claimed-account call passes one.
 *
 * A Ready verdict awaits [NetworkClient.awaitAuthReady], hands the
 * authenticated [HttpClient] to [block], wraps each attempt in [Catching], and
 * emits a structured failure log keyed by [description]. One post-flight remap:
 * a 401 whose token refresh the auth server *rejected* mid-call (see
 * [SessionRejectionBus.rejectionEpoch]) becomes [AuthUnready] with
 * [AuthReason.SessionExpired], so the discovery moment of a dead session speaks
 * the same vocabulary as the pre-flight gate. A 401 without a confirmed
 * rejection (transient refresh failure while holding a session) stays an
 * ordinary [ResponseException].
 *
 * Why pre-flight await: Ktor's per-request timeout starts the moment the
 * call enters the bearer plugin, *including* any wait the plugin does for
 * a token. On a slow first-launch auth bootstrap, that ate most of the
 * 30s budget before the actual server roundtrip even started. Doing the
 * await here means the timeout clock only runs against the real network
 * request.
 *
 * [description] is a short, stable identifier for the call — used as the
 * log message prefix. Pick `"inventory.sync"` or `"wallet.fetch"`, not a
 * sentence; logs aggregate by description.
 *
 * [retry] defaults to [RetryPolicy.None] — opting in to retry is explicit
 * so non-idempotent POSTs can't silently inherit a retry that
 * double-spends. See [RetryPolicy] header for the idempotency tradeoffs.
 *
 * Cancellation is preserved via [Catching] — `CancellationException` is
 * re-thrown rather than swallowed, and the retry loop's `delay` is
 * cancellable.
