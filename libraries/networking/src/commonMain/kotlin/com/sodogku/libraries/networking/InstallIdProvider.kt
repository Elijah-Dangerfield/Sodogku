/**
 * Per-installation identifier the client attaches to every authenticated
 * request via the `X-Install-Id` header (see [ClientHeaders.HEADER_INSTALL_ID]).
 *
 * The id is a UUID generated once on first launch and persisted locally; it
 * regenerates on reinstall (app-local storage is wiped). The server uses it
 * for L1 orphan-account cleanup — see
 * the install-id recovery design notes.
 *
 * Implementations MUST be cheap and non-suspending — they're called on every
 * outgoing request. The expected shape is "hydrate once at boot, cache in
 * memory, return the cached value." Returning `null` is allowed and means
 * "header omitted" — the server treats absence as "client too old to send
 * one." See `CachedInstallIdProvider` in `:libraries:sodogku:impl` for the
 * production impl.
