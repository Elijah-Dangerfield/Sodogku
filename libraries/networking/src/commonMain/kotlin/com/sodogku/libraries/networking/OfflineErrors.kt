 * True when this failure (or one of its causes) means the *device* has no
 * usable network — airplane mode, dead spot, cellular data off — rather than
 * the backend failing. Telemetry sinks use it to keep expected offline churn
 * out of error counts (in production one phone in a tunnel produced 59 error events
 * in 43 minutes). Failures the server could be responsible for — timeouts,
 * refused connections, HTTP statuses — never match, so a real outage still
 * reports.
