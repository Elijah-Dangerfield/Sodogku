/**
 * One-way signal from the token layer to the auth layer: the auth server has
 * **definitively rejected** our session — a 401 whose token refresh the server
 * itself rejected (token revoked, account deleted, refresh token invalid).
 *
 * Deliberately a bus, not a direct call into the auth repository, so
 * [AuthTokenProvider] stays narrow (it depends only on the token gateway, never
 * on the auth repository) and the construction graph stays linear. The auth
 * layer observes [rejections] and tears the dead session down.
 *
 * This is **not** the path for a transient 401 / timeout / 5xx / offline — those
 * keep the session and fall back to cache + an offline indicator. Only a
 * server-confirmed rejection flows through here, because acting on it is
 * destructive (a guest's progress is unrecoverable once the session is gone).
