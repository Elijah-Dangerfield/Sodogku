/**
 * Immutable retry policy passed to `withRetry` / `NetworkClient.authedCall` /
 * `NetworkClient.unauthedCall`. Built with a fluent chain — every wither
 * returns a new instance:
 *
 * ```
 * val policy = RetryPolicy.exponential().withJitter().maxRetries(5)
 * ```
 *
 * **Defaults you should know:**
 *  - [maxAttempts] starts at 1 — i.e. no retries. Opting in is explicit so a
 *    repository accidentally inheriting retry on a non-idempotent POST is
 *    structurally impossible.
 *  - The default [retryIf] predicate retries on transient network failures
 *    only (timeout, 5xx, IO). 4xx (client error) is NOT retried — the server
 *    already processed and rejected the request, the same payload won't
 *    succeed on the next try.
 *  - Cancellation propagates through `Catching {}`'s `shouldNotBeCaught`, so
 *    the loop never spuriously retries a coroutine that was just cancelled.
 *
 * **On idempotency:** retry is a footgun for non-idempotent POSTs (chip
 * purchases, wallet sync). If the server processed your request but the
 * response leg dropped, a retry double-spends. Two ways to stay safe:
 *  1. Don't pass a policy — `RetryPolicy.None` is the default. POSTs to
 *     non-idempotent endpoints just leave it alone.
 *  2. Narrow [retryIf] to network-stack failures only (timeout,
 *     IOException) — those are the cases where the server didn't see the
 *     request at all. Skip [ResponseException] (the server *did* see it).
 *
 * **On offline-aware retry:** the policy retries on [HttpRequestTimeoutException]
 * by default, which doesn't actually tell you whether the user is offline or
 * the server is slow. A true offline-aware retry would defer the call until
 * connectivity returns (different shape — a deferred queue, not a tight
 * retry loop). Filed as backlog; for now treat timeouts as "try again soon"
 * with the cap that exponential backoff gives you.
