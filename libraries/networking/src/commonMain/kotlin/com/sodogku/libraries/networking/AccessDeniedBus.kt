 * One-way signal from the network layer to the app layer: the server returned a

 * (banned/suspended) and any further calls will keep failing the same way.
 *
 * Deliberately a bus, not a direct call into the auth / app layers, so the
 * networking module stays narrow (it depends on nothing app-shaped) and the
 * app layer chooses how to react — today: route to a blocking access-denied
 * screen with localized copy keyed off [Denial.reason]. Sibling shape to
 * [SessionRejectionBus] so the two server-confirmed-rejection paths (401-after-refresh
 * and 403-with-envelope) are mechanically parallel.
 *
 * This is **not** the path for an *un-enveloped* 403 (a route's own permission
 * check, etc.) — only a 403 carrying the wire contract flows through here.
