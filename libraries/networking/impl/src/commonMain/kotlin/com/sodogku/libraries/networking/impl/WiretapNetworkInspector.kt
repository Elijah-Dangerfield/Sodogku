 *
 *  - **Android** uses it as-is — a full-screen Activity whose root maps the
 *    system back gesture to `finish()`, so there's always a way out.
 *  - **iOS** does NOT use it: that path presents a `UIModalPresentationFullScreen`
 *    modal, and the console's root screen has no close button and a full-screen
 *    modal has no swipe-to-dismiss — so you get trapped. The iOS actual instead
 *    presents the console as a page sheet (swipe down to dismiss).

 * Wiretap's own DI, which is bootstrapped by an `androidx.startup` initializer
 * that only runs in a real app process — NOT in host-JVM unit tests (e.g. the
 * `:apps:integration` harness, which runs the real client as `testDebugUnitTest`
 * with `isDebug == true`). Installing it there makes every request crash with
 * `Could not create instance for ...`, so the Android actual skips installation

 * logging the connection, every sent/received frame, and close/error events
 * alongside the HTTP traffic in the same inspector.
 *
 * Gated identically to [installNetworkInspector]: callers wrap it in
 * `BuildInfo.isDebug`, the Android actual additionally skips host-JVM unit tests
 * (Wiretap's DI isn't bootstrapped there), and the iOS noop/real split is driven
 * by `sodogku.wiretap.ios` at the dependency level. Must be installed *after*
 * Ktor's `WebSockets` plugin so it can wrap the raw session before `WebSockets`
 * transforms it.
