     * The active user identity changed. Fired by the auth layer at the single

     *
     *  - `null → X`  first sign-in / guest creation (nothing to clear).
     *  - `X → X`     **not fired** — claim/link keeps the same user; the guest's
     *                progress is theirs to keep.
     *  - `X → Y`     account switch — Y is now active; X's local data was already
     *                wiped (see below) before this event.
     *  - `X → null`  sign-out / delete / forced session invalidation.
     *
     * The actual wipe of the departing user's device-local data (Room tables,
     * profile mirror, account-scoped settings) is **not** a listener's job — it
     * runs through `UserScopedClearer` / `UserScopedDataReset` *before* the new
     * `AuthState` is emitted, so a
     * reactive loader can't race the clear. This event is the *announcement*
     * after the fact, for side-effects that don't hold user-scoped storage
     * (telemetry user binding, dropping an on-screen message).
     *
     * Listeners must run synchronously and must NOT trigger network work.
     *
     * @param previous the user id that was active, or null if none.
     * @param current the user id now active, or null after sign-out / delete.

     * to their own scope.
