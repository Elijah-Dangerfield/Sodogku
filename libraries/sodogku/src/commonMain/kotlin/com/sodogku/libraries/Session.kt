/**
 * A user-perceptible app session.
 *
 * Boundaries (when the [id] rolls over):
 *  - Cold start of the process → session #1.
 *  - App backgrounded for ≥ [SessionTracker.BACKGROUND_ROLLOVER] and then
 *    foregrounded → next session id.
 *
 * Anything shorter than the background threshold stays the same session
 * — quick tab-switches, brief notification interactions, etc.
 *
 * **What this is for:** repositories that want "fetch once per session,
 * then trust the cache" semantics. The shop catalog is the first
 * adopter: on disk, refreshed when [SessionTracker.observe] emits a new
 * id and the persisted `lastFetchSessionId` doesn't match. Pull-to-
 * refresh ignores the session entirely.
 *
 * **What this is NOT:**
 *  - A persisted identifier across process restarts. Each cold boot
 *    starts at id #1 — sessions are process-local. Use [AppData
 *    .lastSessionEndedAt] for cross-launch "have you ever opened this
 *    app" signals; that's a separate concern.
 *  - A user-identity session. Auth state has its own lifecycle.
