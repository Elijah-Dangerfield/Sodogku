     *
     * Why on the scope rather than in a `beforeSend` hook: the SDK persists
     * the scope to disk the moment it changes, and native crashes are turned
     * into events on the *next launch* using that persisted scope. So a route
     * written here is frozen at the instant the user was on it — a crash on
     * this route carries this route, even though it's transmitted later. A
     * `beforeSend` callback, by contrast, runs at next-launch for crashes and
     * would read a stale/empty route.
     *
     * The value sticks until the next navigation overwrites it, and any single
     * event may override it by setting its own `route` tag (a per-event local
     * scope wins over this global one). Best-effort: a no-op when crash
     * reporting is disabled.

     * sent to the backend via `X-Session-Id`, so one id pulls a session's
     * frontend events and backend traces/logs together. Best-effort: a
