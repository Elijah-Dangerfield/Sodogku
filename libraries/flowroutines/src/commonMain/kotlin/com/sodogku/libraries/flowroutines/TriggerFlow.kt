/**
 * A flow that can be used as a trigger mechanism. Emits [Unit] values that can be triggered
 * programmatically via [pull].
 *
 * This is useful for scenarios where you need to recreate or refresh a flow based on external
 * events (e.g., error recovery, invalidation, manual refresh).
 *
 * @param emitInitially If `true` (default), the flow will emit immediately when collected.
 *                      If `false`, the flow will only emit after [pull] is called at least once.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * val trigger = TriggerFlow(emitInitially = true)
 * trigger
 *   .flatMapLatest {
 *     // This block runs initially and again after each pull()
 *     createNewFlow()
 *   }
 *   .collect { ... }
 *
 * // Later, trigger a refresh
 * trigger.pull()
 * ```
