/**
 * Run [work] while a condition holds, instead of when an event happens to be
 * observed. The fix for the lost-edge failure mode: an edge fired before the
 * subscriber attached is gone, but a level read at subscribe time is not.
 *
 * - [key] is the level: `null` = off, non-null = on. A non-null value at
 *   subscribe fires immediately, so late subscribers can't miss an
 *   already-true condition. A key *change* (by equality) cancels in-flight
 *   work — including a pending retry backoff — and fires fresh for the new
 *   key; a change to `null` just cancels.
 * - [refireOn] edges re-run [work] while the key is non-null and are ignored
 *   while it's null. Triggers are conflated: edges landing during a run
 *   coalesce into exactly one trailing run.
 * - A failed run ([work] returning failure or throwing a non-cancellation
 *   exception) retries on [retry]'s schedule while the key holds. Exhaustion
 *   stops the cycle; the next refire edge re-arms with a fresh counter.
 * - [work] runs directly in the per-key cycle scope: `coroutineContext.job`
 *   inside [work] is the cycle's job, and cancelling it externally kills the
 *   whole cycle — pending retries and refire edges included — while the loop
 *   stays alive for the next key. Callers that need to cancel-and-await a
 *   cycle from outside (e.g. quiescing a user's sync before wiping their
 *   data) register that job; pinned by a test.
