 *
 * Flags animated state read during composition, in the two spellings that
 * reach it: `val x by animateFloatAsState(...)`, and a plain `x.value` read of
 * an animation held as a `State` or an `Animatable`.
 *
 * The `by` delegate unwraps the `State<T>` **during composition**, which
 * subscribes the enclosing composable to a value that changes every animation
 * frame. Everything in that scope then recomposes at 60fps for as long as the
 * animation runs, whether or not anything it draws actually changed.
 *
 * This is not theoretical. Downstream it cost four production ANRs: a row
 * component read a pulsing alpha this way, so the text it contained recomposed
 * 471 times in a 25-second trace. Rebuilding that text every frame thrashed
 * Skia's glyph cache and wedged the RenderThread hard enough that anything else
 * needing it — opening a dialog, closing one, drawing an ordinary frame — hung
 * past the ANR threshold. Fixing it dropped that component from 471
 * recompositions to 6.
 *
 * It also hid a second instance of itself: a neighbouring component had the same
 * bug in three places, invisible until the first was fixed. That is what this
 * rule is for — the instance nobody has found yet.
 *
 * **The fix** is to keep the `State` and read it where it is cheapest:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Recomposes every frame:
 * val alpha by animateFloatAsState(target)
 * Modifier.graphicsLayer { this.alpha = alpha }
 *
 * // Recomposes never; the draw phase alone invalidates:
 * val alpha = animateFloatAsState(target)
 * Modifier.graphicsLayer { this.alpha = alpha.value }
 * ```
 *
 * **When composition genuinely needs the value** — usually because it decides
 * which composable to emit — derive the narrower thing it actually needs, so
 * you recompose on that instead of on every frame:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val showingFace by remember { derivedStateOf { rotation.value <= 90f } }
 * ```
 *
 * If neither applies, `@Suppress("AnimatedStateReadInComposition")` with a
 * comment saying why. `Modifier.shadow` is the known-good case: it has no lambda
 * form, so a shadow driven by an animated value has no phase-deferred
 * equivalent. A per-frame recomposition that is genuinely required is fine; one
 * nobody noticed is what causes ANRs.
 *
 * ### The second spelling, and why matching `by` alone was not enough
 *
 * `by` is the readable version of the bug and not the common one. The shape
 * that hid from this rule in three separate files was the early return:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val progress = remember { Animatable(0f) }
 * if (progress.value <= 0f) return
 * ```
 *
 * No delegate, so nothing to match, and it *looks* like the fix — the `State`
 * is kept, and the draw lambdas below it read `.value` exactly as they should.
 * The read on the gate line is the whole composable's subscription to a value
 * that moves every frame, and the `LevelDrawer` instance got there by following
 * this rule's own advice to drop the `by` and then reading the result in
 * composition anyway.
 *
 * So the second pass tracks locals in a `@Composable` that hold an animation —
 * a kept `State` from `ANIMATION_PRODUCERS`, or a `remember { Animatable(…) }` —
 * and reports `.value` reads of them that are not inside a lambda belonging to
 * `PHASE_DEFERRED`, which is the draw, layout, effect and derivation callees
 * where reading is the point. Names only, with no type resolution: a local that
 * is not visibly built from an animation in the same function is invisible
 * here, which is the price of not reporting every `.value` in the codebase.
