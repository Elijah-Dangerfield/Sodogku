/**
 * The two spellings of one bug, and the line between them and the fix.
 *
 * The `by` half shipped first and found nineteen violations. The `.value` half
 * is here because three files had the same bug written without a delegate and
 * the rule could not see any of them — one of them by following this rule's own
 * advice to drop the `by`, and then reading the kept `State` in composition
 * anyway.
 *
 * Most of this file is the negative cases. A `.value` read is the *fix* far more
 * often than it is the bug, so a rule that cannot tell a `drawBehind` from an
 * early return would report the whole design system and get baselined away.
